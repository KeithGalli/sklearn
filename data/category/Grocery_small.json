I had this strange hankering for ginger snap cookies, after not having one for some 20 years. I did a search on Amazon and found these, and was looking forward to them for a month before I finally decided to bit the bullet and just buy it already.All the descriptions of other reviewers sounded so good - I was picturing something a little chewy, with a strong ginger bite to it, and moist chunks of crystalized ginger inside. I feel pretty mislead by the other reviewers, which is rare. Maybe they have been at Trader Joe's so long they forgot what typical food is like for the average schmo, but if you've had the average ginger snap you can buy in any grocery store, you've had something as good (or possibly better) than these. They are very dry - ok, I can get past that, even though I don't like dry baked goods. I can see why some of the reviewers said they were overcooked, they are a bit dark and could qualify as overdone, but I could also get past that. The \"triple ginger\" description seems an overreach - the ground ginger is not very strong as ginger powder goes, and you can't taste the ginger puree at all - it might be apple puree for all that one could taste. But I could get past that too. What was really the last straw was that I ate several of these Nilla wafer-sized cookies without a single chunk of ginger in it! I then took a much closer inspection, thinking maybe somehow I got a defective batch - and found that if I ate extremely slowly, chewing the cookie a good 100 times without swallowing to try to find some texture in it, there was a tiny rubbery bit or two in each that when bit directly onto, tasted like crystalized ginger. Really, I can't believe this led to all the rave reviews here - an ingredient that makes it into the name of the cookie, and yet is so tiny one could easily eat the whole package and never notice it's there. This is a total rip-off, because really, crystalized ginger is not that expensive, it would be easy enough to add several real chunks (and by chunk I mean a piece of crystalized ginger about 2-4mm square, nothing enormous) to each cookie. I can't believe people could get so excited about such a bland, sweet but overcooked, very dry small cookie, with ginger pieces in it about the circumference of the very tip of a pen. I can see why some people said they were good with ice cream or as part of a dessert, but throw a graham cracker in there with a sprinkle of brown sugar and a ash of ground ginger and it would taste exactly the same for a fraction of the cost.I feel like an idiot paying nearly $19 for two tins of ginger snaps that were no better, and maybe a little bit worse, than I could have bought in my local store for $4 total. Buy crystalized ginger itself, or make it, for a fraction of the price and a whole lot less saturated fat, all the health benefits of ginger, and a lot more flavor. That's what I'll be doing the next time I have a sweet ginger craving. (And for those that eat ice cream, chunks of it cut up are amazing in it - I've had it in peach sorbet, and the taste could make you swoon.)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "What crystalized ginger?", "unixReviewTime": 1389225600, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2014"}

That includes culture, beliefs, and food.  For a good portion of my life (almost 2 decades), I grew up on eating instant Korean noodles.  This ranges from the Neoguri, to Jin Ramyun, to Chappaghetti, to Kimchi Ramyun, etc.  If it was a Korean brand of instant noodle, I've probably eaten it.  It wasn't until recently I was getting tired of the same old noodles and wanted to try something new.  I drove to my local Korean supermarket and bought several \"new brands\" of instant Korean noodles, with Shin Ramyun Black being one of them.For those of you familiar with the original Shin Ramyun, I can tell you that Shin Ramyun Black is quite a bit more flavorful.  The Black version comes with 3 packets of seasoning/mix vs the regular version's two packets.  These packets consist of the soup base, the vegetable mix, and the \"sul-long tang\" soup base.  For those of you that don't know what that is, \"sul-long-tang\" is a Korean soup made typically of beef bones and sometimes beef slices.  Traditionally this soup is white/cream colored because of the long (several hours) simmering effect of boiling beef bones.  The marrow eventually gets cooked into the water, creating a beefy creamy/milky flavor.  In my opinion, this is what makes the Black version taste so much different than the original.  Aside from that, the vegetable mix contains chunkier vegetables with a small bits of dehydrated beef.  Personally I think the flavor of this soup is superior to the original... but it comes at a cost....For those of you that are curious about this product, know that it is nearly double the price of the original Shin Ramyun.  I guess Nong Shim considers them \"premium\" noodles (as the packaging states), but is it worth it?  You have to ask yourself, is one single packet worth the double price?  Not really despite the tasty flavor.  However, I ended up getting these on an Amazon Lightning deal for 50% off, so they ended up being the same price as the regular cup noodle version, that's why I took a stab at it.  So if you really want to try these, you can give it a go either on Amazon or your local Asian grocery.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Flavor, A Bit Overpriced - Blame Nong Shim's Marketing", "unixReviewTime": 1390176000, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2014"}

The fire-roasted flavor is natural, not artificial, but it is subtle. This makes the salsa quite enjoyable for many purposes.I really like this as a dip for tortilla chips. This salsa has a good, thick consistency; it is not runny and doesn't have a lot of liquid. The chunks of tomato are plentiful. And because it only has 10 calories per two tablespoons, it is a perfect compliment to chips if you are trying to watch your diet.You can actually see evidence of &#34;fire roasted&#34; in the salsa. There are blackened pieces of skin in salsa, which not only help add to the flavor but also add visual interest. This salsa is also somewhat darker than your traditional salsa, due to the fire-roasted contents.You can add this to your favorite meals as well, wherever a salsa is desired or required, for a slightly different flavor. The fire-roasted falvoring compliments beef and chicken rather well.As a &#34;medium&#34; salsa, this is somewhat spicy, but not incredibly &#34;hot&#34;. It is quite comparable to other &#34;medium&#34; salsas on the market.

I actually did want to drink more tea, if only I could find one that I truly enjoyed. I then moved on to other teas recommended by people that were tea 'experts' so to speak. It was after trying some of those varieties, that I saw such a marked difference in taste and enjoyment. I was now on the path to consuming more tea!! Being health conscious and watching what I eat and drink, as well as, having a daily exercise regimen, I started to look at green tea as a daily beverage option. I had done quite a bit of reading on the subject and as I take various supplements, use protein powder, etc., I wanted to add the benefits of green tea to my regular menu. Try as I might, I wasn't able to find a green tea that had a substantial and pleasing flavor. I had tried several name brands, many of which received glowing reviews, but none excited me in the least. I found many to be very weak, despite the claims of their manufacturers. Many were even downright bitter. Well, I happened to be in a discussion one evening while out for dinner and the subject of  green tea was brought up, followed by the name 'Bigelow'. I obviously had heard the name, but had never tried that particular brand and I was all ears. A number of people at the table drank it regularly. For me, as I stated previously, all the others were either weak (with very little taste), or they had a very bitter aftertaste with a almost 'dry mouth' type of effect. Enter Bigelow green tea. I ordered it here on Amazon. As soon as it arrived, I was ready to try a cup. I followed the directions perfectly when making my first cup and I was extremely happy to find a very substantial and pleasing taste with no bitterness what-so-ever. Even when I accidentally left the tea bag in the cup a bit too long, there were no adverse results. I still had a great cup of green tea. Most directions will tell you to 'not squeeze the bag', but I even tried this just to see what difference, if any, it would cause. What I found was a cup of tea that was still very pleasing in taste, just a bit stronger. Still, there was no bitterness. In conclusion, Bigelow is so very good, that it would take something very extraordinary to have myself even think of making a change. I now sit down to my evening tea, knowing the enjoyment that awaits. I truly think you'll love this tea. As to packaging, the tea-bags are packaged four to a pouch. Carefully open the foil pouch with a scissor at one end, remove a tea-bag and fold the edge of the pouch over to keep the unused tea-bags fresh. There really is no need for each tea-bag to have a separate pouch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It must be Bigelow for me!!", "unixReviewTime": 1400284800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2014"}

However, I had a problem mixing it in cold beverages because it would settle to the bottom in clumps. I bought this dropper bottle at a health food store and decided to give it a try. A great thing about Sweet Drops is that the company does not use glycerine as an emulsifier like NuNaturals Liquid Stevia. Plus, they don't use alcohol (which I cannot use because I cannot digest it). I am very happy with this product as it mixes with no problems. I don't even have to use a spoon because I can just gently stir the beverage by moving it in a horizontal circle with my hand.

Using an Aztec style of flame roasting the vegetables, the flavors are well married and produced a great salsa for cooking as well as dipping.  We've become hooked on this and it's been enjoyed by each person who's tasted it with the exception of a single lightweight.  It's interesting to me that sesame oil is used with no other oils, and I wonder if it is used in the fire roasting process or added to the salsa.  I'd guess that the it's in the roasting and not added to the mix.  Any way it's done, this is a tasty salsa, but the heat definitely overpowers any separation of flavors.

I love apple and cinnamon and almonds.  I figured this would be a great new item to try.  As soon as it arrived I decided oatmeal was what's for dinner.  However, I was somewhat disappointed in the final product.  This is definitely fast and easy and would be perfect for a cold morning in a hurry.  Just put a package of oatmeal and a package of add-ins in your favorite mug.  Use the Keurig cup to add flavor and sugar and 6 ounces of water and in less than a minute you have a nice breakfast.  So what was I disappointed in?  First and foremost is that this was 310 calories!  That seemed like a lot for a small mug of oatmeal and I suspect that a lot of that is the sugar.  I would greatly prefer this in a sugar free version but I might not need the Keurig cup then, just the Keurig hot water????  It is good but not 310 calories good.  Second, I was let down by the lack of flavor.  It sort of tasted like apple and the nuts were there but did not add any flavor and there might have been a hint of cinnamon but all in all I found it lacking in flavor.  Even to lovely, comforting flavor of oatmeal did not come through very much. Third, I comes in a HUGE box -- way bigger than I think it needs to be.  The box is 10 X 8 X 7 (inches).  It takes up much more room than I am willing to dedicate in my cabinet or pantry.  The box is not nearly full and the various parts (you need three things to make each serving) could be packaged carefully and take up much less room.  Perhaps the manufacturer wanted to see if this would be successful before investing in expensive packaging equipment?  Don't know, but I don't want this big box jamming up my cabinets.So this product is not bad.  I really like the idea but they could have done so much better with the execution.  Add more intense flavors, cut the calories and cut the packaging and it would be good.

IMHO the oatmeal is great at the low setting if you include the \"mix-ins,\" a little watery of you don't.I remove the Keurig's pod holder and rinse it out before using these, but maybe I'm just fussy.  I think they ARE better than microwave oatmeal mixes I've had - just because of the \"mix-in's,\" though.

Kernal Season's Ranch Seasoning has a \"ranch\" flavor that is mild enough not to overpower your senses, and it left a pleasant after taste in ones mouth.I have used various Kernel Season's seasonings for at least six, maybe more, years, and I found their latest updated container easy to use.  Over the years, I have found the seasoning, if you don't use it regularly, will start clumping, but that might be more my living in an area that has high humidity.  I have used at least five different flavors (Nacho, White Cheddar, Ranch, Carmel, and Butter) over the years, and Kernel Season's Ranch Seasoning is one of my favorites.  I did find it not as tasty when I drank Coca-Cola, as it seemed to flavors conflicted with each other, but this could just be my individual taste buds kicking it.

To be honest, this was out of ignorance, just assuming that Grade A meant the best quality. The rating system in Canada is different, and it also had a lot to do with color and flavor in those rating letters.I did a head to head taste test with some Ohio Grade A maple syrup that I got at Whole Foods, and this on some fresh Trader Joe's buttermilk pancakes. The difference was clear.The grade A syrup was sweet, more along the lines of taste of a white cane sugar, with the complexity of something like cotton candy. Light, simple. This product has the complexity and sweetness of something like fresh homemade root beer. It has a more earthy complexity, though not aggressive or overwhelming/bitter like you can sometimes experience with molasses, but very interesting and enjoyable.I didn't notice that one syrup was more or less sweet than the other-- the difference was in the taste and color.  If you like the roasted tones in caramel or the complexity of rootbeer (or a nice dark porter) I think you would enjoy this syrup.One of my favorite icings for cinnamon rolls calls for maple syrup as an ingredient, and I can't wait to try this to see how it enhances the flavor!I was surprised to find all of the different uses for maple syrup. I often try to avoid sugar, but do occasionally make fresh iced tea at home. Realizing that this contains a lot of vitamins and minerals, it would be interesting to try this. At least I'd be getting something beneficial as compared to regular sugar!By a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon.

Also, they add salt to this, and I could taste it on my lips, as if I had a drink with salt on the rim.Of course, the purpose of this stuff is to give you the electrolytes that are in coconut water, and I suppose they accomplish that task. But honestly, I keep thinking of Woody Harrelson in &#34;King Pin&#34;, when he takes a drink out of a bucket of bull semen, thinking it's milk.The next day, my friend and me did a taste test. We made a 16 ounce bottle of Coco Hydro as instructed, and I opened a bottle of real coconut water, and marked the cups. We both took turns, and immediately knew which was which. The real coconut water was so rich and flavorful, it wasn't really a contest. The Coco Hydro was weak and cummy tasting, salty.

Lately I've been fortunate in finding high quality products which do seem to provide benefits.  Kiss Me Organics matcha powder seems to have genuinely provided me with a little more energy as well as clearing up some of the brain fog I carry around with me occasionally.  I was suffering from the latter for a couple of days before I started using the matcha, and I really believe that I've been thinking more clearly.  The results are by no means consistent or conclusive so I urge you not to take my word for anything beyond my own experiences.It was really more my intention to review the matcha powder on a culinary level, and on that level I really love this stuff!  It's got a wonderful flavor.  You'll need a blender to get it to mix really well, though.  Unfortunately the vivid green powder can  turn a fruit smoothie muddy, but I don't worry too much about the color unless I'm making something to serve to other people.  And for green smoothies it's perfect.  It adds a slightly different green note than kale or spinach, and enlivens the drink.When you purchase matcha from Kiss Me Organics, you can download a PDF cookbook with a lot of different recipes.  This goes well beyond the standard smoothies.  You'll find recipes for things like matcha brownies, matcha truffles, and even savory dishes like tuna burgers and duck breast.  I can't say that I've gone much beyond the drink stage -- this morning I made a green tea frappucino and it was delicious! -- but I think many of the recipes are worth considering.  One thing I'll say is that the photos may be a bit misleading.  In my experience and as I wrote above, things like smoothies tend to take on a strange brownish color when matcha is added.The one problem I have here is that I think the cost is a bit high.  In a perfect world I'd take off half a star for the price, but as I can't I'm going to err on the side of my taste buds (and more efficient brain, thank you very much) and give it the full five stars.

Needless to say I've gone through a lot of vanilla extract during that time. For me, they all seemed pretty much the same until I came upon the Madagascar Vanilla extract from LorAnn.

I've been able to cut down on the amount suggested in most recipes and still have great vanilla flavor. Plus, I like the taste. It does have a somewhat different taste from most brands of vanilla.

Most canned tuna is albacore, as is this one, but you can also get yellow fin tuna which tastes quite different (better IMHO).  There's quite a variation in canned albacore though.  There's light tuna, solid tuna, etc.  This says &#34;solid&#34; and it's the most solid I've had--meaning that it's basically one solid piece of tuna which almost completely fills the can--which is great.  That's not always the case, and frequently light or non-solid tuna cans contain a bunch of pieces or the tuna falls apart easily.  Not the case here--indeed, you need to put a fork in it to get it out of the can!  It has a nice pull-tab so you don't need a can opener (great if your hiking around for example).  Some cans have water and some have oil.  This variety has olive oil (a good choice which goes well with the tuna--and, if you stir fry like me, you can use the oil in the pan).  The taste of albacore is generally pretty mild, this one IMHO is perhaps a bit tastier than some others.It's nice that they give 13 cents to World Wildlife Fund--it's one of my favorite charities and I donate to them annually anyway.  I've seen the WWF signs in other countries during my foreign travels.  Wild Selections has other varieties such as mentioned above (e.g. light tuna, water based).  This particular variety (solid tuna in oil) is a bit more expensive than some of their other varieties (solid usually costs more in any brand) and is a bit more expensive than some other brands as well--which is the only downside I can see for this product.

I'm not that into cucumbers, but I'm not against them either, and they do have good anti-inflammatory properties (particularly if they are organic, or at least well-washed and at least partially peeled).

Sometimes I don't want so much water content, but I find often that is just when my body is too low on salt so adding some to what I'm eating works fine even if it's on a cucumber. If I still just need something dry to snack on, air-popped popcorn is a lot cheaper and easier to flavor than these crackers.They're not terrible as a product, and I like that they're all-natural, but I personally don't like the taste, and thus the price is especially not worth it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Sigh", "unixReviewTime": 1389225600, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2014"}

This review is based on using this product for Topping rather than Popping.My husband and kids go crazy over popcorn, especially over movie theater popcorn.

I'd already put what I thought was a decent amount but he went an added more to his.  He loved it.  He said he thought it would've  pretty similar to movie theater popcorn if I'd allowed him to use all that he wanted.  To me, since I only used what I considered a decent amount, it didn't do a lot for me.  I didn't think it had a very buttery taste.  My daughter even melted some additional butter to put on hers.  My son enjoyed it just how I made it.So, we all 4 had varying thoughts about this product.  Had I used way more than I did, I probably would've liked it just fine but I refuse to add that many calories.  If you are someone that could care less how much you use or the amount of calories that you are eating them I'm sure you'll like this just fine.  If you are someone like me who only want the labeled serving size then it may not be enough flavor to make you like it.  I add popcorn seasonings on mine to give it additional flavor so I'm all right with the taste one I add the seasonings.I would recommend trying this, just know that it takes a good amount to make it taste like you probably want it to taste.  3 1/2 stars based on the mixed feelings in my house.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Pretty Decent, Takes a Lot for Topping, Mixed Review, 3 1/2 Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1401580800, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2014"}

I mean, why bother right? Isn't the sole purpose of coffee consumption based on the fact that it contains mood and energy elevating caffeine? Sure, until it is the caffeine that is the common denominator for some troubling symptoms. I know, I know, caffeine is not necessarily bad, and in fact can be very very good. However, some people are sensitive to it, or become sensitive, or becomes part of the problem.  *sad face*For me, for a few reasons, I needed to cut back. Thought that wouldn't be a problem, except that in recent years, I had actually learned to enjoy the taste of *good coffee*, and would actually miss the taste and ritual of making a cup-- even with other fine substitutions that I use (dandelion coffee and other alternatives are very good-- but they are really only that- alternatives).So, I was accidentally given a box of Newmans Own decaf, which sat unopened for a year. I recently decided to try it. Having had their original (good, but a little light for my taste), I thought maybe it would be an adequate substitution. I was wrong, it really tasted more like water than coffee. On the plus, I found it works well as a carrier for an evening cup of coffee and Irish Cream. My next foray into decaf was when I tried a sip of Donut House, and was pleasantly surprised that it had a regular coffee smell with a stronger (yet still inadequate) coffee flavor over the Newmans Own. I would buy Donut House again as it is at least readily available at local stores.Since I am a great fan of Dark Magic extra bold k-cups, and have preferred them time and time again over several dozen other brands of Kcups, I decided to check out the reviews for their decaff offering between here, the company website, and the Keurig website. When I saw reviews that stated that they loved the regular, and thought the decaff tasted like the regular, I had to order a box immediately.I drink 1/2 to one Dark Magic regular cup of coffee most mornings. However, if I find am not sleeping as well, or blood pressure is going up, or just don't feel the desire for caffeine (over taxed adrenals?), yet I still want a cup of coffee, a good cup of decaff does the job. I found that good cup in &#34;Dark Magic Extra Bold Decaf&#34;; it really does taste amazingly like their caffeinated counterpart. Nothing about it tastes like &#34;brown water&#34;.  It tastes like regular coffee. But you have to like bold, biting coffee.Seriously, it tastes so much like regular coffee that I really did go back to the box, and the cups to make sure it said decaf.I will be ordering this brand again.

I went looking for the whole wheat Hodgson Mill lasagna noodles I usually buy and my supermarket was all out of them.  I prefer whole grain pastas and I saw these from Tinkyada, so I bought them instead.  I've had good luck with Tinkyada pastas in the past, so I figured I would be happy with these.These are pretty good lasagna noodles.  They're the kind you have to cook (by boiling) on the stovetop first, but I prefer that kind.  (Some of the no-boil ones get too crunchy for my taste.)  They didn't stick together during cooking; the water from cooking was slightly discolored, but that seems common to Tinkyada pastas and doesn't affect the taste at all.I followed the directions on the box and boiled these for slightly less than the stated cooking time, since I planned to put them in the oven afterwards.  If I had it to do over again, I would probably boil them for a minute or two longer, as they were a little tough.  (Also, I know that other Tinkyada brown rice pastas stand up well to overcooking.)  However, despite the toughness, I was pleased with the result.  I thought the taste was very good, as well, and they were not too \"rustic\" as whole grain pastas tend to be.  The lasagna made with them has also been very good as leftovers.A few of these did rip apart just a little after cooking.  This was about the same as what I've experienced with other brands of lasagna noodles, though.If you're going to use these in lasagna, make sure the top is covered with cheese and sauce, or the top layer of noodles will dry out a little bit.Overall, I'm pleased with these and would definitely consider buying them again.

It boosts energy and metabolism.  It can increase your focus. It can improve over all skin health.  It's full of anti-oxidants.  It has been rumored to battle cancer successfully. There's even evidence that one of the antioxidants found in green tea can generate new brain cells. Matcha is finely ground, high quality green tea powder.  It has 137 times the antioxidants found in brewed green tea.  The higher quality the matcha, the more sweet and intense the flavor. It is popularly used in tea, noodles, as a dye, and in Japanese confections.I'll be honest.  I don't like green tea.  For years, I've had people trying to push it on me, stating how healthy it is.  If I can't stomach the taste, it doesn't matter how healthy it is.  Now, here's the problem. What I've tried in the past has been factory brewed and bottled green tea.  Or green tea bags.  I don't care for it at all.  I find it bitter with a chalky texture.Matcha is definitely different than green tea.  It doesn't have the chalky texture and it doesn't have the bitterness.  I still wouldn't call it sweet, but it's definitely more tolerable.  My discovery into Macha has been slow-moving.  I began by putting a teaspoon in with my coffee grounds when I made coffee.  As I became more bold and began to realize that I didn't hate green tea after all, we diversified into green tea milk shakes, green tea and cilantro bread, and every other idea we could come up with.  Eventually, we grew incredibly bold and made green tea cupcakes with green tea frosting. Delicious!  Honestly, my favorite way to consume green tea!  It was sweet, but still had a slight tea-ish flavor to it.Kiss Me Organics offers high quality Matcha that is available only through Amazon.  It's finely ground and organic and can be put into most anything in order to get your daily dose, which is about 1/2 teaspoon to a teaspoon.

Mellow, pleasant flavor.Brooklyn Bridge Medium Roast-3&#8212;I like this one.  Not too strong.  Nice flavor.  Smooth.  Not quite as good as some of the Green Mountain medium roasts, but still perfectly acceptable.French Roast Dark Roast-2-Noticeably weaker than Tully&#8217;s French Roast, which is very strong and smoky, but to be fair Tully&#8217;s FR is extra bold, and this is not.Hazelnut-3-My wife is a hazelnut coffee connoisseur.  She likes this one a lot and thinks it is better than Green Mountain Hazelnut, the one she usually drinks.Oh Fudge-2-The only flavored-type I tried, it has a strong aroma of chocolate.  It tastes like a bit like a Hershey bar.Corner Donut Shop Medium Roast Extra Bold-3-At first I thought this one was too weak, but it grew on me.Boardwalk Blend Medium Roast -3-Just ok.Breakfast Blend Light Roast-3-Again, just ok.Cyclone Dark Roast Extra Bold-2-Neither dark nor bold enough for me.Cinnamon Subway-2-My wife did not particularly care for this one.I have not yet had a chance to try the following varieties in this pack:Coney Island Caramel-2Expess-O Espresso Roast-2Colombian Medium Roast-3Breakfast Blend Decaf-3Vanilla Skyline-2Maple Sleigh-2Overall, I would put most of these coffees somewhere between Green Mountain K-cups, which are better, and some others I have tried, such as Martinson&#8217;s, San Francisco Bay, and Dunkin&#8217; Donuts, which are worse.

Lipton bags are not. If you travel with the Lipton, you need to carry them in a baggie or small box.The one thing that really bugs me about the Lipton Cold Brew is the powder residue. Lipton grounds the black tea so fine that is leaves a powdered residue, even dry. The dry residue isn't too bad because it usually remains contained in the box or whatever container I use. However, if you don't remove the bag from the water soon after you make the tea, you get all this stuff floating in the bottom of the glass and it looks yukky.Overall, great tasting tea especially for traveling.

The package it came in was secure. I had no problems with it, nor concerns.  My sister lives with me, and she asked if she could also try the tea. I brewed two cups. She loved hers  and said it tasted just as it should, but I did not like the taste of mine at first. She is however more use to Green Tea  flavor than I am.  She suggested that I try it in a Smoothie. Hum, okay I'll give it a shot.  How did that turn out. Well, I could tolerate it much better in a Smoothie, and after several sips I actually enjoyed it, somewhat. .  Perhaps my next use of it will be in a cupcake with lots of icing. Okay, maybe not too much icing.I do like all the benefits that consuming Green Tea does for your body in so many areas, and this product seems to be packed with them.  Actually I had forgotten how good it is for you, and when I finished my  Smoothie I was happy to have helped my body.  I just need to get use to the taste of it again. I have had some everyday and I actually believe my body is consuming its goodness. I do feel more alert and less tired.  I believe for  Green Tea users this product delivers what you are expecting.

These 70% cocoa manufactured in New Hampshire chocolates have a more creamy texture to them, something you don't usually find in high percentage dark chocolates.If you are already a dark chocolate aficionado, then you may not like this - unless you want to try it as a curiosity.In the past, this was a more classic dark chocolate. Lindt changed the formula, but they made the mistake of 1) not giving it a different name  2) not explaining it on the box. They should have 1) kept the original formula for loyal fans of the original, 2) created a new line of \"Smooth Dark Chocolate\" or \"Creamy Dark Chocolate\" or \"Dark Chocolate for Dummies\" line for this formula. This would have kept fans of the previous recipe happy and attracted dark chocolate \"beginners\" to the new creamy version.The list of ingredients is nowhere near as long as mass market commercial chocolates. You get: chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, soya lecithin (emulsifier), bourbon vanilla beans. That's all. There are ten squares in a thin wrapper. The box recommends 4 squares as the serving size, but you can obviously eat as few or as many as you like. Four squares are 250 calories with 19g fat (12g sat, 0g trans), 0mg cholesterol, 10mg sodium (0%), 17g carbs (3g fiber, 12g sugars), 3g protein, and single figures of iron and Calcium. Recommended temperature is 60 to 68 degrees (F) and dry - per the packaging.Price wise, if you are planning to eat small portions (eg one square a day), this is competitive versus mass market chocolates since their list of ingredients is longer and more offensive from a dietary perspective than the Lindt.I liked the taste of this, but I am not a dark chocolate purist.  I am not picky on chocolate, my main problem with chocolate is the calories. The 70% dark is certainly a higher percentage than what most mass-market chocolates have (most of them are milk chocolates).

After 5 minutes I observed that the water was a light yellow (not bright yellow or orangey, which indicates a dyed imitation).  I removed the strands and saw that they were still red (fake saffron will turn a light color, since it was dyed to look red).  Finally, I added some stevia and drank the \"tea\" - it had a distinctive grassy flavor and aroma with a slight bitter undertone.  I am satisfied that this is authentic saffron.Saffron has wonderful anti-oxidant qualities and it's benefits include helping female issue such as menstrual pain and menopause symptoms.

That means that the stevia extract - the SECONDARY ingredient in this product - contains at least 95% steviol glycoside.  That DOES NOT MEAN that 95% of this jar contains stevia and the rest is erythritol ... FAR FROM IT.  The label on this sweetener is deliberately written to mislead the reader - if the actual percentages of erythritol and stevia were openly disclosed to consumers, they wouldn't sell much.Yes, erythritol does in fact occur naturally in many fruits, but it occurs there in such microscopically small amounts, that it's completely impractical to obtain it from any \"natural\" sources. Instead, erythritol is manufactured by chemically converting GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN into food-grade starch which is fermented to create glucose, and then processed further to create erythritol. Sound natural to you?  Cargill, the makers of Truvia, recently settled a class-action lawsuit about this very thing - misleading consumers by calling their product (that's mostly erythritol) \"natural.\"And contrary to what others have said in reviews or 'answered questions' here about this sweetener, BRAZIL DOES GROW GMO crops - corn, soybeans, and others - and has for years - but that's COMPLETELY BESIDE THE POINT.  The ingredient in this sweetener that was derived from GMOs is the erythritol, NOT the Brazilian stevia.
